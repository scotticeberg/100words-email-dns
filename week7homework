For week 7 I watched the movie Enemy of the State. Even though this movie is nearly 20 years old, the technology featured
in the film doesnt seem dated. The spy technology used in the movie was based on real spy tech that was available
at the time the movie was filmed. Its crazy to think of what capabities spy agencies, like the NSA and CIA, have today.
