Since attending ITC 102 my view of techonology has changed in that I have come to realize more that knowledge of computer technology 
required to attain employment required much more self driven education than formal education. For example, as has been reitered in this 
class, if one wants to learn a certain programmin language one goes to the online forums to do so; rather than a formal class in school.
It is also neccissary to be a jane of all trades, so to speak, in that one must have a broad knowledge of many inter-related diciplines.
This ability to have broad knowledge, and be self-sufficient education wise, will ensure a person can remain a desired employee for years
to come.
